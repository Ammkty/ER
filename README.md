# SoilErosionDB
## This repository is about a global surface runoff and soil erosion database
Soil erosion is a major threat to soil resources that results in environmental degradation and social poverty in many parts of the world. Many field and laboratory experiments have been performed over the past century to study soil erosion spatio-temporal patterns under different environmental conditions. However, these historical data have never been integrated together in a way that can inform current and future efforts to understand and model soil erosion at different scales. Here, we designed a soil erosion database (SoilErosionDB) to compile field and laboratory measurements from sites across the globe. The database focuses on three erosion-related metrics - surface runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient leaching - and also records background information. Currently, measurements from 99 geographic sites and 22 countries around the world have been compiled into SoilErosionDB. The SoilErosionDB includes 18 columns for soil erosion related indicators and 73 columns for background information that describe factors such as latitude, longitude, climate, elevation, and soil type. We provide examples of linking SoilErosionDB with an external climate dataset, and using annual precipitation from the external climate dataset to explain annual soil erosion variability under different environmental conditions.
